## RPG Maker Plugin Support

### Free Plugins
We encourage you to use various social outlets for support when it comes to our free
community plugins, as we do not offer email support for them

:::tip
Please note that LTN Games does periodically engage with these outlets, so you may still receive "official" support.
:::

Here's a list of social outlets where you can seek help with our free plugins:

__Online Forums__
* RPG Maker Web Forums
* RPG Maker Central
  
__Discord Servers__
* LTN Games
* Lunatic Server
* RPG Maker Portal


### Premium Plugins
If you've purchased one of our premium plugins, you have access to our email support.
This premium plugin email support allows you to contact us regarding any issues you
encounter with your premium plugins. Feel free to inform us about any of the following concerns:

* Compatibility issues
* Performance problems
* Bugs
* Documentation errors
* General plugin advice
* Demos and other asset files
* Other inquiries

To ensure a smooth support process, we recommend using the same email address that
you used for your premium plugin purchase. If you decide to use a different email
address, you may be asked to provide proof of purchase for verification purposes.
