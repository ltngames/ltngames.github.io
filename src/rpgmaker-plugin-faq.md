**Q: How do I make the most of the demo files?**

A: Getting started with our demo files is a breeze! Simply initiate a fresh project in RPG Maker MZ, and then sprinkle some magic by copying the contents of the demo archive into the root directory of your new project. Don't forget to add the latest version of this plugin into the "plugins" directory of your shiny new project.

**Q: Bug hunters unite! How do I report a pesky bug?**

A: We appreciate your vigilance! To report a bug, please shoot us an email or tag us in our Discord server. Just remember, the bug needs to be reproducible in the demo (created by combining a new project with our demo files) before it lands on our investigation radar.

**Q: Can I request new features?**

A: Absolutely! We're all ears for your brilliant ideas. Whether your concept is a small tweak or a grand transformation, don't hesitate to email us with your proposal. We'll review your suggestion and let you know if it's a star we can add to our constellation.

**Q: What happens when the plugin gets a makeover? Do I get updates?**

A: You bet! Whenever we release updates and squash those pesky bugs, you'll be the first in line. Just revisit the plugin's product page and grab the latest version. It's all part of the package.

**Q: Do you provide active support for your plugins?**

A: You're in good hands! We're committed to supporting our plugins for years to come. Any bug reports that come our way are our top priority, and we strive to fix them as swiftly as possible.

**Q: Tell me about these beta releases. What's the deal?**

A: Betas are our secret sauce! They're updates that fine-tune previously released plugins. Occasionally, we'll also offer a plugin for sale while it's still in beta. It's like a sneak peek behind the curtain.

**Q: Release or beta, that is the question. Which one should I choose?**

A: We recommend reaching for the stars with the plugin labeled "release" unless you're feeling adventurous and want to explore upcoming features and fixes. In that case, our beta version is your ticket to the future.
