## RPG Maker Plugin Support

### Premium Plugins
If you've acquired one of our premium plugins, you're entitled to premium support. We offer multiple avenues for assistance, including email support and Discord, to cater to your needs. Here's how you can access these premium support options:

##### Email Support:
Premium plugin users have the privilege of reaching out to us via email for dedicated assistance. You can use this email support to address a range of concerns related to your premium plugins. Whether you're encountering compatibility issues, performance bottlenecks, bugs, documentation errors, seeking general plugin advice, or have questions regarding demos and other asset files, we're here to help.

##### Discord Support:
In addition to email support, we've created a Discord support channel where you can connect with our support team and fellow users. This channel serves as an interactive community hub for sharing your inquiries, discussing solutions, and collaborating on plugin-related topics. It's an excellent platform for real-time discussions and assistance.

##### Recommendations for a Smooth Support Experience:
To ensure a seamless support process, we recommend using the same email address that you used for your premium plugin purchase. This helps us identify your premium plugin ownership quickly, streamlining the verification process.

However, if you choose to use a different email address, please be prepared to provide proof of purchase to facilitate verification. Our goal is to make your premium support experience as efficient and effective as possible, so you can get back to enjoying your premium plugins with confidence.

Feel free to reach out to us through your preferred support channel, and we'll do our best to assist you promptly and effectively. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we're committed to resolving any issues or questions you may have with your premium plugins.

### Free Plugins
When it comes to our free community plugins, we recommend taking advantage of various social platforms for support, as we do not provide email support for these offerings.

However, it's important to note that LTN Games periodically participates in these platforms, so you may still receive "official" support when needed.

Here's a list of social outlets where you can seek assistance with our free plugins:

__Online Forums__
* RPG Maker Web Forums
* RPG Maker Central
  
__Discord Servers__
* * Official RPG Maker Server
* LTN Games
* RPG Maker Portal

These platforms serve as vibrant communities where you can connect with fellow users, share your inquiries, find solutions, and engage in discussions about our free plugins. While we don't offer email support for these plugins, we're still committed to providing valuable assistance through these social outlets to ensure you have a positive experience with our offerings.
